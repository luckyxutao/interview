1 Some people say that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

2 They think the world is just what you can touch and hear and see,

3 while others say the tales and legends cannot be dismissed.

4 They believe with all their hearts that fairies truly do exist.

5 Through out all time, human beings and fairies never met,

6 till one very special summer that we shall not soon forget.

7 Life is rising up Surging forth in all directions

8 Every little buttercup Is reaching out to find connections

9 Every blade of grass Will touch the sunlight

10 The rain will touch the ground

11 Growing greener than it was before

12 Bees are droning by Spider silk is softly spinning

13 Not a cloud in the sky You know it's only the beginning

14 Every little blossom, every flower Flings its petals wide

15 As the season comes round Once more

16 Hey, Tink! You ready for your first summer on the mainland?

17 Absolutely! It's so beautiful out here.

18 I can't believe we get to stay for the whole season.

19 Well, what are we waiting for? Race you down!

20 The breeze is blowing light and sweet The grass, a carpet at your feet

21 Catch the colors Feel the heat of the sun

22 All the sparrows in the dell Swirling round like a carousel

23 Singing loud enough to tell everyone

24 Hi, guys.

25 Summer's just begun

26 Summer's just begun

27 There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

28 All the winters, all the springs

29 Lead us here on fairy wings

30 A season of a thousand things To be done

31 Summer's just begun

32 Summer's just begun

33 Hiya, Cheese!

34 Summer's just begun

35 - Did you have a nice flight? - Incoming!

36 Keep her level! Keep her level!

37 Gear it down, Bobble!

38 Oh-ho!

39 - Smashing landing, Clanky. - Thank you, Bobble

40 Guys, I think you may have over-packed.

41 - Come on, Tink. Let's go inside. - Inside?

42 Tink, fairy camp isn't out here in the open.

43 We need to stay hidden from the humans.

44 - We do? - Uh. Yeah.

45 That's why fairy camp is in here.

46 Cicadas, one at a time. You, you and you. You, too.

47 Wow. lt's like all of Pixie Hollow under one tree!

48 Blaze!

49 Hmm?

50 The Queen Anne's lace is looking beautiful.

51 - How are the looms working? - Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

52 Next. Next. Next.

53 - Hows the bee-liner working? - Like a dream Tink. Thanks

54 Great. Need any help with that wagon?

55 No, thanks. She's running fine.

56 Okay. Glad to hear it.

57 Here's the first week's supply.

58 Okay, I'm off. I gotta go deliver pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

59 but I'll see you in a couple days.

60 Oh, and Tink! Don't worry. You'll find something to fix.

61 I hope so.

62 In the meantime I need to go find some lost things.

63 Hold on, little miss spare parts.

64 You're not going near the human house, are you?

65 - There's a human house? - No! I mean, yes, but no.

66 - We stay away from humans. - Oh, Iridessa!

67 - Tinker Bell knows that, don't you? - Define "stay away"

68 It's gonna be a long summer.

69 Grouchy.

70 - Oh, that's just Vidia being Vidia. - No, the air. It smells...

71 ...grouchy.

72 - We might be in for a storm. - Come on Sil.

73 The sun is shining, the air is warm. It's a beautiful day. Nothing's gonna...

74 Tinker Bell.

75 Thank goodness we're here, Father. It's just like I remember it.

76 Wel, of course, my darling.

77 Look at the creek and the woods and the meadow

78 Oh! I wish it was summer all year long!

79 Yes, Lizzy.

80 Tinker Bell, what are you doing here?

81 Vidia, this is amazing! It's a carriage that moves by itself!

82 There's no horse. Seriously, look.

83 - Do you see a horse up there? - Uh, No.

84 It'is a horseless carriage! And do you want to know how it works?

85 - Not really. - So do I.

86 I think those wheels back there move because this chain thing rotates

87 And I think what rotates the chain is this big...

88 I don't care Tinker Bell. You shouldn't be this close to the human house.

89 What if they see us?

90 Will you stop flitting around in there? This is serious!

91 You know what, Vidia? I think this powers the whole thing!

92 This, my dear, is exactly why tinkers shouldn't come to the mainland. They...

93 Let me know if this does anything.

94 Well, anything? Vidia, you're all wet.

95 You don't say.

96 Father, Father Father! Can we bring our tea and scones outside

97 and have them here in the garden?

98 - It would be just like a little picnic. - Not just now, Lizzy.

99 I still have to get the trunk unpacked and the house settled

100 Father, look! What a magnificent butterfly.

101 My word. Absolutely astonishing.

102 It's so beautiful. What kind of butterfly is it?

103 Well, judging from the epidermal membrane, it's cleary an apatura iris,

104 but the wings have two entirely different patterns.

105 Well, that's neary impossible.

106 Well, I guess that's just the way the fairies decided to paint it.

107 Hmm?

108 Lizzy, faires do not paint butterfly wings

109 because, as you know, fairies are not real.

110 - Hmm! - Ugh!

111 But of course they are. The proof is right here.

112 - Their paint dripped all over its wing. - Really, darling.

113 Rational people consider a belief in fairies to be quite foolish.

114 The wings are so fresh.

115 What are you doing?

116 Its chrysalis must have been in the meadow.

117 The meadow? Father wait!

118 That's where I'm going. Would you like to come?

119 Not now, Lizzy. I have to update my field journal.

120 My interview at the museum is tomorrow night

121 You're going back already? We just got here.

122 I know, sweetheart, and I'm very sorry. But I'll only be gone for the day.

123 Mrs. Perkins will look after you, and I'll be back in time to tuck you in.

124 - Promise? - I promise.

125 - Okay. - That's a good girl.

126 All clear!

127 Come on, Vidia.

128 - I can't fly. My wings are wet. - Oh! That's right. Sorry.

129 Guess you'll have to walk back.

130 But don't worry, I'll keep you company. Actually, it might be nice

131 Or not So, I think I figured out the carriage.

132 Those bottles of goop must keep it running smoothly,

133 like snail slime, you know?

134 Hate to see the size of the snail that stuff comes from. And at first...

135 Here's your house, little fairies. Wherever you are.

136 Hmm Just needs a little something more.

137 But I haven't quite figured out what that sparky wire does.

138 Hey! Maybe the whole carriage runs on lightning!

139 Are those wet wings still bugging you? Here, Vidia, let me help you.

140 Tinker Bell, maybe if you spent less tme causing disasters,

141 you wouldn't have to help everybody so much.

142 - Hmm. The truth hurts, doesn't it? - Look! We can use these back at camp!

143 Wow. These'll be perfect for the new wagon prototype I've been working on.

144 Here. I bet if I took two or three and tied them together,

145 I could make one really strong wheel!

146 It's a good thing we were walking or we might never have seen these.

147 Vidia, where are your buttons?

148 Tinker Bell, am not carrying this human junk back to camp.

149 - Let's go! - Let's go!

150 Tinker Bell, we're not supposed to go near human houses.

151 This isn't a human house.

152 They're a lot bigger.

153 Besides, the sign says, "Fairies welcome."

154 Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

155 Tinker Bell, you're not going in there.

156 Please tell me you're not going in there! She went in there.

157 Tinker Bell! Don't eat that! This could be a trap.

158 Come on, Vidia. It's perfectly safe.

159 Oh, really?

160 - Oh, Vidia - Huh! Not so safe now, is it?

161 Nice try, Vidia, but you re not scaring me.

162 Gosh, this thing is amazing.

163 You just don't know when to stop, do you?

164 Oh, no. Tink! Someone's coming!

165 The door is stuck!

166 Come on, Vidia You can do better than that.

167 - Tink! - I wonder what this part does.

168 Tink! I'm serious! Get out of there!

169 Just a second. Just a second.

170 Vidia? Vidia?

171 Oh Vidia, come on. Open the door. You had your little...

172 Oh, no. What have I done?

173 Vidia? Okay, not funny anymore.

174 A fairy!

175 It's a real fairy!

176 Father! Father!

177 Father!

178 - Father! Father, Father! - Yes, Lizzy.

179 You're never going to believe what I found.

180 - Maybe later, Lizzy. - But Father, Father, Father,

181 - Father Father - Just a moment, dear.

182 - I'm very busy with my project. - Yes, but Father!

183 - Father! - Lizzy, please.

184 I must add this extraordinary discovery to my field journal.

185 And here t is.

186 Is that the butterfly we were looking at earlier?

187 Yes. Quite a specimen isn't it?

188 You re not going to take it to London, are you?

189 Yes of course.

190 The board of trustees would never believe me

191 if they didn't see it themselves.

192 Now I'm sure to get that curatorship at the museum

193 Besides, as a member of the scientific community,

194 I'm obligated to share significant findings like this with my colleagues.

195 I know it's unfortunate for the specimen, but really, there is no otherway.

196 Now, dear. What did you want me to see?

197 Uh ...

198 Never mind.

199 Where have you gone?

200 Mr Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

201 Mr. Twitches!

202 Bad cat! No, no, no!

203 Don't worry, little fairy.

204 Mr. Twitches won't bother you as long as you're in there.

205 Naughty cat! You're going outside.

206 Tnker Bell's been captured by humans!

207 - Oh, no. - What happened? Is she okay?

208 - Is she all right? - What's this? Tinker Bell?

209 - What happened, Vidia? - Is she hurt?

210 Tinker Bell went into this little house in the meadow and couldn't get out.

211 The door got jammed.

212 Then this human came from out of nowhere and snatched her up,

213 but I know where she is. We have to hurry and save her.

214 Then we better leave right away!

215 Sil, do you think the storm will pass soon?

216 No, it looks like it's gonna get stronger.

217 Well, there's gotta be some way to get to Tink.

218 We can't fly in the rain and the meadow's already flooded.

219 Maybe we don't have to fly.

220 If we get some big leaves and sew them togetherwth stem twine...

221 And miter-cut some twigs for the sub-flooring.

222 Acorns as counterweights.

223 Some quick-dry maple sap as reinforcement.

224 What are you two talking about?

225 - We're gonna build a boat! - We're gonna build a boat!

226 - More mushroom caps, p ease! - Here we go.

227 This one goes there. That one goes there. Right?

228 Righty-o, Bobble.

229 - Right, more reeds over here. - This thing had better work.

230 Give me the sap.

231 You dip it in this way and give it a big slap like so.

232 Ow. Ow. Ow.

233 Come on. Come on. Let's get going.

234 There you go. Now you're talking!

235 It's working!

236 Well, this is it.

237 Hey, faith...

238 Trust ...

239 - And pixie dust. - Pixie dust.

240 Come on. Come on.

241 Hello.

242 You don't have to be scared. I'm very nice

243 You're so ittle.

244 Your dress is very leafy. Did you make it yourself?

245 I like your wings. They're like sparkly lace.

246 Your hair must be so soft.

247 Are you hungry? Maybe not. That's okay.

248 I don't like some kinds of food, either.

249 Oh!

250 I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?

251 There you go.

252 Wait! Wait! Wait! No, please! I'm not going to hurt you!

253 Don't be afraid I just want to be your friend!

254 I really won't hurt you. I just love fairies.

255 I've been drawing fairies all my life. See?

256 I drew that one when I was three but I did that green one last week.

257 I think it's much better.

258 I even started to paint with the watercolors Father gave me.

259 Is it true that some fairies paint butterfly wings?

260 I knew it!

261 These are some of my favorite drawings.

262 This is a water fairy.

263 - You can tell because her skin is blue. - Blue?

264 And here is a candy fa ry living in a lollipop tree

265 Do all fairies live in trees made of sweets?

266 Really? What about fairy circles?

267 Well, I hear that if a person steps in one,

268 a fairy has to grant them three wishes from their magic bag.

269 But if they don't, they turn into a pile of del cious sugar,

270 - and then younger fairies - Wait. Wait a minute.

271 ...must try and turn them back into... - Where are you getting all this?

272 You jingle when you talk, like a little bell!

273 So thats how fairies speak.

274 So what do you think of my fairies? Oh! And my fairy house!

275 It got a little shaken up.

276 Did you make this?

277 I don't know what you're saying.

278 Oh. Did I make the fairy house? Yes, I did. Do you like it?

279 Oh. The door's stuck.

280 Well, you're quite the little tinker, aren't you?

281 What? Is that your name? Tinker?

282 Er ...

283 Bell? Your name is Bell.

284 Tinker? Bell?

285 Tinker Bell? Tinker Bell.

286 What a lovely name! Well, Tinker Bell, my name's Lizzy.

287 Do all fairies sound the same when they talk?

288 How do you learn to be a fairy? Do you go to fairy school?

289 Lizzy?

290 Lizzy? Who are you talking to?

291 My fairy!

292 That's nice, dear. Now, I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.

293 These are some of my old field journals.

294 Now, I picked out the ones I thought would excite you the most.

295 This one on rocks and minerals is particulary interesting

296 - Is there a field journal about fairies? - Of course not, Lizzy.

297 Books like this are based on fact and scientific research,

298 which is the quite the contrary to your little figurines and drawings.

299 Well, just because you've never seen a fairy doesn't mean theyre not real.

300 Now, Lizzy, seeing is believing, and without proof, it's just a fairy tale.

301 Now, here is a blank field journal Now, you're very talented, my darling,

302 and I'm sure you'll be able to fill it with your own scientific research.

303 Yes, Father.

304 Now if only these leaks were just pretend.

305 Tinker Bell, you can come out now.

306 Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me your collection, but I really should be...

307 You want to go?

308 Oh. I really wish you'd stay.

309 I'm sorry, Lizzy.

310 Okay, I understand.

311 So, I guess this is goodbye.

312 What's wrong? Can't you fly in the rain?

313 You can stay with me until the rain stops.

314 I'll show you around my room. We can play with my toys.

315 We'll have so much fun.

316 - We're past the shallows! - Aye Drop the ma nsail!

317 Dropping the mainsail!

318 - Trim the sail! - Trimming the sail!

319 - Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port! - Hard to port! Hard to port!

320 I recognize that wagon. Stay on this course!

321 - Aye, Miss Vidia. Will do. - I sure hope Tink is all right.

322 Who knows what terrible things could be happening to her right now.

323 A fairy could get used to this.

324 Isn't it wonderfu? Everything in this house is just your size, Tinker Bell.

325 That's perfume. It smells like flowers.

326 Oh. My doll. She should be in bed by now.

327 How old are you? I'm nine.

328 Do you like my dollhouse? Do fairies live in houses?

329 What are fairies' houses made of?

330 That's a cooker, but it doesn't actually work.

331 Whats your favorite food? I mean, besides sweets?

332 I want to know all about real live fairies.

333 Perfect!

334 "Scientific fairy research."

335 Okay. What's your favorite color?

336 Green is my favorte color, too!

337 I should start from the beginning. Where do fairies come from?

338 I mean, where were you born?

339 Oh.

340 Well, that one's a lttle more complicated because...

341 So, a baby, when it laughs for the first time...

342 A fairy...

343 - Uh... Uh... - Oh.

344 Right. One second.

345 You were a funny-looking baby?

346 A baby?

347 Laughs?

348 One?

349 First?

350 When a baby laughs for the first time, thats when a fairy is born

351 Incredible.

352 Lizzy, that's only the beginning.

353 Guess I always knew

354 This could all come true

355 Still it feels so new

356 Being here with you

357 Can't believe my eyes

358 A new world comes ailve

359 Spring and summer Love and laughter

360 We'll live happy ever after

361 We'll shine brighter Than we thought we'd be

362 Because you showed me How to believe

363 More than just pretend

364 I'll make believe again

365 I hope this never ends

366 Maybe we'll be friends

367 Now everything I know Everything I know

368 I'll never let it go Never let it go

369 Spring and summer Love and laughter

370 We'll live happy everafter

371 We'll shine brighter Than we thought we'd be

372 Because you showed me How to believe

373 Okay, everybody, listen up.

374 This road should take us straight to the human house.

375 So how far is it from the road to the house, do you think?

376 Not that far, realy. The only question is, how flooded is it?

377 That's a good point.

378 Well, I'm gonna remain optimistic.

379 - We'll get to Tink in no time. - I'm with you, Sil.

380 We're almost there.

381 Why, look, we're picking up speed already.

382 Did you feel that? We're moving faster.

383 Hey, guys! We're heading right for a waterfall!

384 Great polliwogs! We have to make the turn!

385 Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

386 What?

387 Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

388 - What? - What did he say?

389 Loosen the ropes and...

390 ... turn the sail!

391 - Oh, no! - Look out!

392 Man overboard!

393 Hard to port! Hard to port!

394 Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

395 Guys! We're running out of river!

396 That's all right, 'cause all we need's a little.

397 - Rosetta, come grab my feet. - What?

398 Hang on! We're going straight down!

399 Oh, no!

400 Brace yourselves!

401 - Who's alive? - Not me

402 Me, either. I can't find a pulse! It's not there

403 I'm teling you, I don't... Oh. I'm good.

404 Oh! Sorry!

405 Looks like were walking from here.

406 - But... Walking where? - We could be anywhere.

407 Everything looks the same from down here.

408 And there's no way of knowing which way to go.

409 Clank! Where did you find that?

410 I don't know. Here on the ground. Is it yours?

411 I know where we are.

412 Tinker Bell this is so fascinating. Thank you.

413 I had no idea fairies were responsible for changing the seasons.

414 I thought it had something to do with the Earth's axis

415 as it rotated around the sun.

416 That's what we wanted you to think.

417 Well, I think we've covered everything. Oh. I hope Father's impressed.

418 And now for the finale.

419 The whole fairy land, Pixie Hollow.

420 It worked! Tinker Bell, I can't wait to show Father.

421 Tinker Bell? Are you all right? Tinker Bell?

422 Huh?

423 Oh Sorry. Yeah, let's go show yourdad.

424 Looks like the rain has let up some.

425 You might be able to make it home to your frends now.

426 Maybe this could help you.

427 Oh, yes.

428 Such a clever tinker.

429 Take care of yourself.

430 I'll never forget you, Tinker Bell.

431 You'd best hurry. The break in the weather may not ast long.

432 Goodbye.

433 And I'll never forget you, Lizzy.

434 - Father, look - Not just now, Lizzy.

435 My hands are rather full at the moment.

436 I made t especially for you, Father. It's just like your field journal.

437 - It's filled with lots of facts. - Yes, yes, that sounds wonderful,

438 but I'm in the middle of a potent al catastrophe here.

439 I can't look at it now.

440 - But Father, it's a field journal, and I... - I don't have time.

441 I have to find some way to deal with all these leaks

442 before they destroy my work.

443 - When will you be able to look at it? - I don't know. Maybe later.

444 You always say that.

445 Tinker Bell!

446 You came back! I'm so glad to see you.

447 Tinker Bell, Father has no time forthe field journal.

448 I think I can fix that.

449 Vidia, you sure you know where you're going?

450 Yes. Tinker Bell and I walked by here.

451 I just have to find the road.

452 Road? What road?

453 That road!

454 That's not a road. That's a muddy river.

455 So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

456 Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

457 It's not deep We can walk across.

458 Yeah, no. I don't really do mud.

459 - But you're a garden fairy! - Ironic, isn't it?

460 Rosetta!

461 Okay, all right. I'm coming.

462 It's squishy. Oh! What was that?

463 She's stuck!

464 I can get myself out of here.

465 All right, all right.

466 Someone just get me something to grab onto

467 - Got it! Clanky, rescue device. - Right, Bobble. You can count on us!

468 Okay. Let's give this a try.

469 Do you feel that? She's starting to break free.

470 I don't think so.

471 - Come on, hurry! - Pull! Pull!

472 Pull!

473 Pull!

474 Hello? Is somebody out there?

475 Anyone?

476 - Grab this! Hurry! - Are you kidding me?

477 Trust me. And hold on tight.

478 Oh well.

479 We got the...

480 ...rescue device. - You scared the petals right off of me!

481 Did we miss anything?

482 "My, what a splendid tea service. I am really quite impressed.''

483 Then I say,

484 "Why, thank you, Tinker Bell.

485 "You are too kind."

486 You hold your pinkie out, like this,

487 and that's the way you throw a proper tea party.

488 Good night, Lizzy.

489 There we... Oh!

490 I'm going to bed.

491 There just aren't enough hours in the day.

492 Oh. Good morning, Tinker Bell. How did you sleep last night?

493 Well, I... Actually, I didn't, but that doesn't matter.

494 You should go downstairs to your father

495 - Lizzy? - Yes, Father?

496 Good morning, my dear. All the leaks seem to have stopped.

497 I just wanted to make sure everything is okay in here.

498 Yes. Just fine. No leaks at all. So...

499 Strange It's as if they mended themselves.

500 It's still raining outside.

501 I can't imagine how on Earth such a thing could occur

502 Well, there must be an explanation that I'm just not thinking of.

503 Well, I'm sure you'll think of it, Father.

504 - Off we go. - Perhaps down in your study.

505 You always do your best thinking there. I wish you luck.

506 - Okay, well, play nicely - Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

507 Oh! That was close.

508 What are you doing? This s your chance

509 Is that why you fixed those leaks?

510 So he can spend more time with me?

511 I've really been wanting to show him this

512 Okay, okay. I'll go.

513 Father, since you have more time,

514 maybe I can show you my scientific research.

515 - The butterfly. It's gone! - What?

516 The apatura iris with the irregular wing pattern.

517 I was going to present it to the museum tonight.

518 Oh! This was my big opportunity, and now it's gone

519 - Elizabeth, did you release it? - No.

520 Well, I didn't do it.

521 And since there is no one else in the house,

522 there is only one logical explanation.

523 - It must have been you. - I didn't do it, Father.

524 I'm going to give you one more chance. Tell me the truth.

525 I could tell you, Father, but you wouldn't believe me.

526 Very well. Off to your room, young lady. I'm very disappointed in you.

527 You know, I was just thinking, if Tink were here

528 - how not quiet it would be right now. - You can say that again

529 Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

530 That's the exact shade!

531 Quite a bit of spirit in that little tinker, eh?

532 That's for sure. In fact, I still can't believe she got captured.

533 Yeah. It's very unlike Tink to be caught with her guard down.

534 - I wonder what really happened. - Well we'll find out soon.

535 Yep. With every step we take we come closer and closer to Tinker Bell

536 She'll te us what happened.

537 Listen, there's something you a should know.

538 Tinker Bell getting trapped is a my fault!

539 I slammed that door on Tinker Bell, to teach her a lesson

540 I tried to get her out, but the door was stuck.

541 I tred, but I couldn't, and now I've put her and all of us in danger.

542 I am so sorry.

543 Honey, this is not your fault.

544 We a know that Tink can get into plenty of trouble all by herself.

545 It scares me to think what would have happened if you weren't there, Vidia.

546 I don't know what to say.

547 - How about faith... - Trust...

548 - And ... - And ...

549 And pixie dust.

550 And pixie dust!

551 Can you reach it, Clanky?

552 - Almost. Just a little more. - Here, let me.

553 Okay. Now, can you see anything?

554 No! There's a big building in the way.

555 Building. It's a house. That's it! Clanky! We've got it!

556 - What've we got? - House! Get off.

557 - I'm sorry. - I can't feel my legs.

558 It doesn't matter what I say. He never believes me.

559 I'm so sorry, Lizzy.

560 I'm so glad you're here.

561 You're my best friend.

562 I wish I were a fairy, just like you.

563 Then I could help the flowers bloom and talk to animals

564 and fly around with the other fairies all the time.

565 That would be fun.

566 Where are we going?

567 What is going on up there?

568 I was going to present it to the museum ton ght.

569 Now the butterfly is gone.

570 Oh, my! I'm... I'm flying!

571 Look at me! Whee! I'm a fairy!

572 All clear!

573 - Sorry. - Oh! Careful.

574 - That's my ear - Sorry.

575 - Sorry. - That's the nose Careful.

576 - Whoops! Sorry. - Can't see!

577 Okay. Tinker Bell is upstairs. The little girl has her in a cage.

578 In a cage?

579 And there's also a large human in the house

580 who doesn't like creatures with wings. He pins them up in display cases.

581 - Great. Anything else? - Oh, yes. The cat

582 Cat! What cat?

583 - That cat! - That cat!

584 Fawn, you're an animal fairy. What are we supposed to do?

585 - Fawn? - Fly!

586 Our wings are wet.

587 And who knows when they'll be dry.

588 Okay, okay. Run!

589 - Clank! - Come on!

590 - Clank! - I'm okay.

591 We still need to get to that stairwell. Any ideas?

592 If we could just build a brdge or something

593 - That's it. A bridge! - Guys? Guys?

594 - A bridge made out of what? - Guys!

595 Clank! You're a genius!

596 Huh? Uh.

597 It was nothing.

598 All right. Let's do this.

599 - We need some more plates! - Okay. Start passing them up Clanky.

600 Aye, aye! Here they come!

601 Get ready for more. Oh, hello!

602 We've got a full plate back here!

603 No, no, no. No. No, please.

604 Get back!

605 Get back!

606 Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

607 That is exactly what you think it is. Catnip!

608 You get to Tink and we'll take care of the cat!

609 Got it!

610 - Lizzy? - Coming, Father!

611 - Lizzy? - Why, hello, Father. May I help you?

612 - What's going on in here? - Nothing.

613 Nothing? Sounds like a herd of elephants have been marching up here.

614 Look at this room. It looks like a cyclone hit it.

615 - It's not that bad. - Not that bad?

616 Your books are a overthe floor, your toys are everywhere

617 and you tore your curtains What?

618 How did you get footprints on the ceiling?

619 This is simply too much.

620 A temper tantrum of this magnitude is unacceptable.

621 But I wasn't having a tantrum!

622 Then how did this happen? And the truth this time.

623 If I tell you the truth you still won't believe me.

624 Elizabeth, the truth.

625 I was flying. My fairy showed me how.

626 Oh, forgoodness sake. Your make-believe fairy did this?

627 You've got to stop this nonsense!

628 But it's not nonsense, Father. It's the truth!

629 You have a real fairy living in your room?

630 Yes! And I can prove it.

631 Just look at the research we did.

632 Elizabeth. This is what you've been doing?

633 Field journals are to be filled with fact, not fairy tales.

634 But Father, these are facts!

635 I don't understand this foolishness, Lizzy. You have such talent

636 - Why would you waste it this way? - Why can't you just believe me?

637 I believe in what is real,

638 and it's about time you started doing the same.

639 Father, wait!

640 I know this is difficult for you to understand

641 but this is all make-believe.

642 - No! They're real! - Elizabeth, this discuss on is over.

643 But Father!

644 It ... It.

645 See? I told you. Faires are real!

646 It's okay. She won't hurt you.

647 It's... Well, it's extraordinary!

648 Aren't her wings beautiful?

649 Yes. Very similarto Apoidea. Or, no, no, odonata.

650 Look at the limb proportionality to the cranial radius.

651 - Fascinating! - Isn't she magical?

652 She's some sort of evolutionary mutation

653 She's not a bug, she's a person.

654 - Exactly! - Tinker Bell

655 This is going to be the discovery of the century!

656 Tink, watch out!

657 - Vidia? - Get out of the way!

658 I must get this to the museum right away!

659 Father, no!

660 Please, Father! Wait!

661 - You can't do this - Lizzy, I don't have much time.

662 The trustees will only wait for me until 9:00

663 Please, go back in the house.

664 Don't worry. Mrs. Perkins wil be here any second.

665 Tinker Bell, I'm so sorry!

666 My father's taking your friend to the city!

667 Step, step step.

668 - Tinker Bell? - Tinker Bell!

669 Look, it's your frends.

670 - Hurry - That's it. Good kitty.

671 Look, Lizzy's father trapped Vidia in a jar while she was saving me.

672 - We have to hurry and rescue her. - Here we go again!

673 - How are we gonna get there? - Yeah, it's still raining.

674 Maybe we can't fly in the rain but I think I know someone who can.

675 I'm scared. Tinker Bell.

676 Floating around my room is one thing, but flying all the way to London

677 That easy. huh?

678 Okay. I'll be brave.

679 All right, fairies. We need all the pixie dust we can get.

680 This girl's got a long journey ahead of her.

681 All aboard!

682 Ready?

683 This better work.

684 Oh! Sorry, fairies.

685 Careful now!

686 Hi, Mrs. Perkins. Bye, Mrs. Perkins.

687 Bye, dear. Fly back soon.

688 Oh! Good idea.

689 Sorry!

690 Out of the way!

691 There he is!

692 Tinker Bell, I can't keep up. He's going too fast.

693 Tink! Tinker Bell, no!

694 No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

695 Come on, please, let them still be there.

696 - Father - What in the world?

697 Father, stop!

698 Don't take her in there!

699 It... It... It... It can't be.

700 Lizzy? You re flying.

701 Yes, I am.

702 But how? How are you doing that?

703 My friends showed me how.

704 I... I don't understand.

705 You don't have to understand.

706 You just have to believe.

707 I do believe.

708 I do believe!

709 Oh! Father!

710 Lizzy, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

711 I'll never doubt you again.

712 Vidia!

713 - Let's go home, Father. - But how?

714 Think happy thoughts.

715 - Lift your arms and kick yourfeet! - Careful!

716 I think I'm gettng the hang of it. Yes! Why, I'm flying!

717 - You're doing it, Father! You're doing it! - I could get used to this! Just a second.

718 There's something I've always wanted to do. Follow me!

719 - Hey Tink. - Hey, Vidia.

720 So, you ever been to one of these before?

721 Yeah. It's pretty fun.

722 - What are you supposed to do? - It's easy. You just pick this up.

723 - Like this? - Yeah. And then you hold it out.

724 - Got it - Now, just raise your pinkie, like this.

725 And then you say, "Excuse me, miss, but may I have a spot of tea?

726 Why, certainly, Miss Bell. A nice, fresh cup.

727 Oh. But of course you may have one, too.

728 This is a tea party after all.

729 How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

730 Why, of course, Doctor.

731 - It's my pleasure, I'm sure. - Thank you.

732 - And would you ike one lump or two? - Make mine three.

733 Oh. father!

734 Thank you.

735 - Isn't this pleasant, Father? - I can't imagine anything better.

736 Although, chiming the Big Ben comes a close second.

737 - Oh, my goodness. - Scrumptious.

738 Don't even think about it.

739 So, where were we? Ah, yes.

740 "Fairies have many magica talents. They can ta k to an mals,

741 make the flowers bloom, create warm summer breezes."

742 Oh. Lizzy, what a beautiful drawing.

743 "And some invent the most clever little gadgets."

744 Well, Tink you found something to fix after all.

745 Yeah. I guess I did.

746 "They bring the change of seasons, and help nature in many ways.

747 "But the best talent a fairy can have is simply being a friend. '

748 The breezes blow the clouds away

749 A million things I want to say

750 I don't ever want this day To be done

751 Summer's just begun
