### [TCP 为什么三次握手而不是两次握手（正解版）](https://blog.csdn.net/lengxiao1993/article/details/82771768)
But the sequence number doesn't start at 0. It starts at the ISN (Initial Sequence Number), which is a randomly chosen value. And since TCP is a bi-directional communication, both parties can "speak", and therefore both must randomly generate an ISN as their starting Sequence Number. Which in turn means, both parties need to notify the other party of their starting ISN.
TCP是一个全双工通信，两端都能发送数据，因此需要把自己seqNumber互相告诉对方
```
Alice ---> Bob    SYNchronize with my Initial Sequence Number of X
Alice <--- Bob    I received your syn, I ACKnowledge that I am ready for [X+1]
Alice <--- Bob    SYNchronize with my Initial Sequence Number of Y
Alice ---> Bob    I received your syn, I ACKnowledge that I am ready for [Y+1]
```
